## Any questions? 

* The floor is yours before we move onward...

---

## Introduction to geography

* Discuss with your colleagues: what is *geography*, exactly?  

---

## The three "W's" of geography

* What is where?

* Why is it there?  

* Why do I care?  

### In short: geographers are understanding *why* the world is organized the way it is, and what the implications are for society, politics, religion, environment, climate, etc...

## What do geographers study?

Lots of things...

## Global health

---

## How can all of this be geography? 

### Unifying theme: all these topics concern the geographic distribution of some phenomena on the Earth

### Major sub-disciplines:

* Human/cultural geography

* Physical geography

* Society/environment relations

* Geospatial technology/geographic information science

---

## Major approaches to the study of geography

* Qualitative methods (e.g. ethnography, document analysis)

* Quantitative methods (e.g. statistics, data visualization)

* Mapping &amp; geospatial science

---

## Why does all this matter to us?  

* Course goal: to use a geographic perspective to help us understand some of the most pressing global issues

* We'll accomplish this by studying major themes (urbanization, disease, environmental degradation) in the context of the world's major regions
