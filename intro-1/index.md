## So what is this course about?  

### **TCU catalog:** 
"A survey of the world's primary regions and the human and physical geography that shape them. Interactions between natural environment, cultural geography, geopolitics, history, land use, and economic geography are highlighted."

### **Translated:** 
This course is a forum for us to discuss and engage with the most important global issues of the day!

## Any questions? 

* The floor is yours before we move onward...

---

## Introduction to geography

* Discuss with your colleagues: what is *geography*, exactly?  

---

## The three "W's" of geography

* What is where?
* Why is it there?  
* Why do I care?  

### In short: geographers are understanding *why* the world is organized the way it is, and what the implications are for society, politics, religion, environment, climate, etc...

## What do geographers study?

Lots of things...

## Global health

---

## How can all of this be geography? 

### Unifying theme: all these topics concern the geographic distribution of some phenomena on the Earth

### Major sub-disciplines:

* Human/cultural geography
* Physical geography
* Society/environment relations
* Geospatial technology/geographic information science

---

## Major approaches to the study of geography

* Qualitative methods (e.g. ethnography, document analysis)
* Quantitative methods (e.g. statistics, data visualization)
* Mapping & geospatial science

---

## Why does all this matter to us?  

* Course goal: to use a geographic perspective to help us understand some of the most pressing global issues
* We'll accomplish this by studying major themes (urbanization, disease, environmental degradation) in the context of the world's major regions
